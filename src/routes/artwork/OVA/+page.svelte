                This short animation was my contribution to my teams larger submission to the OVA competition during highschool. The OVA is a New York State wide competition in which teams form and compete in creative problem-solving events. My teams chosen topic was censorship. I wanted to focus on the unknown hero, known only as "Tankman," and his courage in standing against the army approaching Tiananmen Square. This project involved setting up a green screen and keying myself into the blender scene. Our team ultimately placed second place!
